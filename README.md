### Hi there. Ismail here. ðŸ‘‹
:dolphin: CTO/Engineering Manager/Developer at Maritimetrainer

Ahoy there! ðŸš¢ Once upon a time, I was a code-slinging sea dog, but these days, as the CTO of Maritimetrainer, I've traded my keyboard for a captain's hat. Now, I'm navigating the choppy waters of product development, riding the waves of cutting-edge technology, and dropping anchor for some quality time with our customers. But the real treasure? My crew of tech-savvy buccaneers (aka my friends) who join me on this AI-powered voyage. Together, we're charting a course through the digital seas, turning maritime training into a swashbuckling adventure! When I'm not at the helm, you might find me daydreaming about the good ol' days of debugging â€“ or planning our next AI-driven conquest. All hands on deck for innovation! :metal: :metal: :metal:
